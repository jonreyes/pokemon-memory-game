## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

StackOverflow, Mozilla Developer Docs, W3Schools, and other resources through Google were all referenced. 
IP credited from the official games and anime by The Pokémon Company as assets found across the web especially the Pokémon Fandom Wiki.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

Customizing the additional optional features to make the game more interesting with the Pokémon theme was more challenging.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

For web development I do not have specific questions, but I have become more curious about css/js animations as well as web design tools like Figma when working with UI/UX.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If this was a longer term project I would use better local version control over git and use a front end library such as React.js and Redux.js if state management becomes too complex.
The code was also focused on quick "hackathon-like" implementation rather than clean design and planning, so a fluid user experience is interrupted with bugginess especially with longer patterns and interaction use cases.
